        This is not the problem with most things as we can see them. But particles are very very small, so small that the electromagnetic waves we see are too big to touch them. So we can’t see them. We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves of much smaller wavelengths but more wavelengths mean more energy. So when we touch a particle with more energy it alters it . So we can’t measure elementary particles precisely. This fact is known as Heisenbergs’s Uncertainty Principle . It is the basic principle of all quantum physics . We just know that particles exist as we cannot see them. Then the theory of point particle originated .It is a hypothesis saying that the particle is in certain point at space having certain charge and mass . With this theory the Physicists could carry out all the calculations.This theory was called quantum theory and solved many problems . With this theory some properties of elements were tested and proved to be accurate upto 0.0000000000002%.

       In quantum mechanics all physical forces are carried out by certain particles. There is no precise way to measure things in quantum world the story of gravity doesn’t work with story of quantum physics. Then the string theory was born. String theory describes many different elementary particles as mode of vibration of a string. String theory unified all fundamental forces of the universe. String theory requires 10 dimensions to work out but our universe had 4 dimensions. No one was able to convert the dimensions of string theory into dimensions of our own universe. So, string theory was not accepted by the scientists but string theory has been a major step in revealing the truth about quantum gravity. If this theory is proved then we can figure out how black holes work. Hence, the string theory was created to solve Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle and perform quantum calculations which was later rejected by the scientists.
